<h1> The utmps-write program </h1>

<p>
utmps-write is a command-line generic utmp client for utmps.
It sends an arbitrary utmp entry to the utmpd and/or wtmpd daemon. It can
be used to test utmps installations.
</p>

<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>
     utmps-write [ -u ] [ -w ] [ -U <em>utmpd-socket</em> ] [ -W <em>wtmpd-socket</em> ] [ -t <em>timeout</em> ] [ -T <em>timestamp</em> ] [ -h <em>host</em> ] [ -i <em>ip</em> ] [ -l <em>user</em> ] [ -p <em>pid</em> ] <em>id</em> <em>type</em> <em>line</em>
</pre>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>utmps-write</tt> constructs an utmp entry of type <em>type</em>, with identifier <em>id</em>, containing the line <em>line</em>. </li>
 <li> Other fields can also be manually filled via options; by default, <tt>utmps-write</tt> will put in reasonable values. </li>
 <li> <tt>utmps-write</tt> connects to a <a href="utmps-utmpd.html">utmpd</a> and/or a
<a href="utmps-wtmpd.html">wtmpd</a> instance, and sends them that utmp entry for writing. </li>
 <li> It exits 0 on success, or prints an error message on stderr. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 The <em>type</em> argument must be symbolic: EMPTY, BOOT_TIME etc. The valid types
are the symbolic constants for the <tt>ut_type</tt> field of the <tt>utmpx</tt> structure,
as documented <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/utmp.5.html">here</a>
or in the <tt>utmps/utmpx.h</tt> header provided with the utmps package.
</p>

<h2> Options </h2>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>-u</tt>&nbsp;: add the entry to the utmp database. </li>
 <li> <tt>-w</tt>&nbsp;: add the entry to the wtmp database. At least one of the <tt>-u</tt> or <tt>-w</tt>
option must be given. </li>
 <li> <tt>-U</tt>&nbsp;<em>utmpd-socket</em>&nbsp;: if the <tt>-u</tt> option has been given,
connect to a utmpd instance listening on <em>utmpd-socket</em>. The default is the compile-time
default, <tt>/run/utmps/.utmpd-socket</tt> or the value given to the <tt>--with-utmp-socket</tt>
configure option. </li>
 <li> <tt>-W</tt>&nbsp;<em>wtmpd-socket</em>&nbsp;: if the <tt>-w</tt> option has been given,
connect to a wtmpd instance listening on <em>wtmpd-socket</em>. The default is the compile-time
default, <tt>/run/utmps/.wtmpd-socket</tt> or the value given to the <tt>--with-wtmp-socket</tt>
configure option. </li>
 <li> <tt>-t</tt>&nbsp;<em>timeout</em>&nbsp;: if the operations have not been completed
under <em>timeout</em> milliseconds, exit with an error message. By default, <tt>utmps-write</tt>
will wait forever for an answer from the utmpd or wtmpd daemons. </li>
 <li> <tt>-T</tt>&nbsp;<em>timestamp</em>&nbsp;: spoof the <tt>ut_tv</tt> field of the utmp
entry. <em>timestamp</em> must be given as an absolute
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/libtai/tai64.html#tai64n">TAI64N label</a> in external TAI64N format,
prepended with a <tt>@</tt> character. By default, <tt>ut_tv</tt> will contain the time when
<tt>utmps-write</tt> was invoked. </li>
 <li> <tt>-h</tt>&nbsp;<em>host</em>&nbsp;: spoof the <tt>ut_host</tt> field of the utmp entry.
By default, it is empty (all null characters). </li>
 <li> <tt>-i</tt>&nbsp;<em>ip</em>&nbsp;: spoof the <tt>ut_addr_v6</tt> field of the utmp entry.
<em>ip</em> can be given as an ipv4 or an ipv6 address. By default, it's <tt>::</tt> (all null
characters). </li>
 <li> <tt>-l</tt>&nbsp;<em>user</em>&nbsp;: spoof the <tt>ut_user</tt> field of the utmp entry.
This can only be done by root, otherwise the utmp or wtmp daemon will refuse to add the entry.
By default, the field contains the user's name as obtained by
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/getpwuid.html">getpwuid()</a>. </li>
 <li> <tt>-p</tt>&nbsp;<em>pid</em>&nbsp;: spoof the <tt>ut_pid</tt> field of the utmp entry.
By default, the field contains the pid of the <tt>utmps-write</tt> process. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Notes </h2>

<ul>
 <li> There is an official API to <em>write</em> a complete utmp entry to the
utmp or the wtmp database, and this is what <tt>utmps-write</tt> uses. However,
there is no official API to <em>read</em>, and format, a complete utmp entry from
the databases; you can read them from instance via util-linux's
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/utmpdump.1.html">utmpdump</a>
utility, but you need to give it the direct path to the utmp and wtmp files. </li>
 <li> The wtmp database can only grow; a user calling <tt>utmps-write -w</tt>
repeatedly can easily make it grow fast and indefinitely, using up all the available
disk space. This is a fundamental problem with the design of utmp, and is already
achievable without the use of <tt>utmps-write</tt>. The only solution is for
administrators to detect fast-growing wtmp files, and clean them up or archive them. </li>
</ul>
