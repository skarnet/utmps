Changelog for utmps.

In 0.1.2.1
----------

 - Adaptation to skalibs-2.13.0.0.


In 0.1.2.0
----------

 - Make the wtmp file name configurable.


In 0.1.1.0
----------

 - New binary: utmps-write. It's a generic utmp client, writing
user-defined records to the utmp and/or wtmp databases.


In 0.1.0.3
----------

 - Adaptation to skalibs-2.11.0.0.


In 0.1.0.2
----------

 - Bugfixes.
 - The wtmpd example now uses /var/log/wtmp instead of /run/utmps/wtmp
since wtmp is supposed to survive across reboots.
 - WTMPX_FILE, which is unused by utmps, now points to /var/log/wtmp
so that programs that want to read that file (e.g. lastlog) can
access wtmp without patching. Or with less patching.


In 0.1.0.1
----------

 - Bugfixes.
 - The addition of WTMP_FILE counts as a bugfix, too. :P
 - Alignment to the glibc behaviour for pututxline().
